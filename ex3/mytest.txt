Exercise 1:
(Basic, 30%)
A doubly linked list is similar to a linked list, however, it
has in addition to a pointer to the next element also one to its predecessor. E.g., a seating
order in a cinema may be represented this way. Everybody (except the two at the outer
ends) has two neighbours, their right and their left neighbour.
